## Why We Built VeriWeb

Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly common. A link may appear completely normal, but a single click can expose passwords, banking details, and other sensitive personal information.

Many users fail to notice the subtle warning signs hidden within malicious URLs. VeriWeb was created to help people pause, evaluate links carefully, and stay safe before clicking.

## What VeriWeb Does

VeriWeb is a web application that analyzes a given URL and determines whether it appears safe or potentially harmful.

The system provides one of three classifications:

- Safe  
- Suspicious  
- Likely Phishing  

In addition, it generates a risk score and clearly explains the reasons behind the classification.

The primary objective of VeriWeb is to make cybersecurity simple, understandable, and accessible to everyone.

## How It Works

When a user submits a URL, VeriWeb evaluates it against common phishing indicators, including:

- Unusually long URLs  
- Presence of the `@` symbol  
- Use of IP addresses instead of legitimate domain names  
- Excessive hyphens  
- Suspicious keywords such as `login`, `verify`, `bank`, or `secure`  
- Use of unsecured HTTP protocol  

Each identified red flag contributes to the overall risk score.  
The final score determines whether the URL is categorized as Safe, Suspicious, or Likely Phishing.

## Why It Matters

Phishing attacks are often successful because users are unaware of subtle warning signs.

VeriWeb promotes cybersecurity awareness and encourages safer browsing practices. It empowers users to make informed decisions before interacting with potentially harmful links.
