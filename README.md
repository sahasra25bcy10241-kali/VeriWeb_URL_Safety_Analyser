Why We Built VeriWeb
Phishing attacks are becoming more common every day.
A link may look completely normal, but one click can expose passwords, banking details, and personal information.
Most users do not notice the small warning signs hidden inside URLs.
We built VeriWeb to help people pause, check, and stay safe before they click.
What VeriWeb Does
VeriWeb is a web application that analyzes a URL and tells users whether it appears safe or suspicious.
It gives one of three results:
Safe
Suspicious
Likely Phishing
It also provides a risk score and clear reasons explaining the result.
The goal is to make cybersecurity simple and accessible for everyone.
How It Works
When a user enters a URL, VeriWeb checks for common phishing indicators such as:
Unusually long URLs
Presence of the @ symbol
Use of IP addresses instead of proper domain names
Excessive hyphens
Suspicious keywords like login, verify, bank, or secure
Use of unsecured HTTP protocol
Each detected red flag increases the risk score.
The final score determines the classification.
Why It Matters
Phishing attacks often succeed because users are unaware of subtle warning signs.
VeriWeb promotes cybersecurity awareness and encourages safer browsing habits.
It helps users make informed decisions before interacting with potentially harmful links.
